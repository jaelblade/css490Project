Market Analysis: Research or alternatives: James. Interview professors
Goals: Develop a system to objectively monitor audiences engagement level.

Milestone 1: Dig into Kinect, view video tutorials
Milestone 2: Create interface
Milestone 3: Create design
Milestone 4: Modify facial recognition
Milestone 5: Get meaningful input from Kinect
Milestone 6: Prototype
Milestone 7: Create project proposal/ design document
Milestone 8: Record and playback useable data
Milestone 9: Write test

Risk: No one understands SDK
Risk: Project not feasible
Risk: Lack of hardware
Risk: Language used
Risk: Schedule doesnâ€™t account for unknowns

Strength, Weaknesses:
Stretch goals:

Use Case:
Institution reviews student engagement numbers to assess teacher performance.
Instructor uses real time feedback to assess a classes interest in the topic at hand.
Instructors use the device to modify lectures in a way that engages students.
Student listens better while hands are busy.
Student researches lecture while listening.
Instructor sets up Kinect with software and starts software services. Software monitors room to measure number of students looking at lecturer during the lecture. Engagement metrics are displayed in real time and recorded to be reviewed by instructor after lecture. Instructor views metrics and correlates spikes and lulls with topic or event.

Unknowns:
Time tables
individual skills
ability to work together
user requirements
User roles


Next steps: Read some SDK, Experiment!, discuss design
