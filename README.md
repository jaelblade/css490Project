##Project Details

###Original Project Details
Use Kinect2 and the included framework to monitor an individual and their current "state" and determine the effectiveness of their focus and/or studying.

###Original Project Reasoning
One hour of studying while attentative and focused is worth hours of studying while unfocused.

###Adapted Project Details
Using the Kinect2 in a classroom environment, use the body and face position framework to determine where students are directing their attention in order to determine how interested the students are in the professors lession.

###Adapted Project Reasoning
Scale the project usability factor by expanding the original scenario to a classroom. This will make the project more interesting and also involve more students and professors to provide input.
